Spring 2025

This project applies machine learning techniques to segment customers based on personality traits, demographics, and purchasing behavior. The goal is to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize resource allocation by identifying distinct customer groups.

Project Highlights:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling numerical features for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing patterns and correlations in customer data.
- Clustering Techniques: Implementing K-Means clustering to segment customers into meaningful groups.
- Insights & Business Impact: Understanding customer behavior to drive personalized marketing and strategic decision-making.
- This project demonstrates how data-driven customer segmentation can enhance business efficiency, customer engagement, and revenue growth.

**_Objective_**

In an effort to optimize marketing efficiency and enhance customer experience, the company has embarked on a mission to identify distinct customer segments. By understanding the characteristics, preferences, and behaviors of each group, the company aims to:

- Develop personalized marketing campaigns to increase conversion rates.
- Create effective retention strategies for high-value customers.
- Optimize resource allocation, such as inventory management, pricing strategies, and store layouts.
- As a data scientist tasked with this project, your responsibility is to analyze the given customer data, apply machine learning techniques to segment the customer base and provide actionable insights into the characteristics of each segment.

Criteria
Exploratory Data Analysis
- Add the problem definition - Data Description - What is the background of this data? What does it contain? - Write the observation from the Data Description such as the shape of the data, data types of various attributes, and statistical summary. - Perform and add observations for Univariate and bivariate analysis (variable distributions, interactions between variables) to understand the relationships in data - Observations & Insights - What are some key patterns in the data? What does it mean for the problem formulation? Are there any data treatments or pre-processing required?
Comments
You have performed a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, exploring patterns, distributions, and correlations between variables. Visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, provide clear insights into data distribution and relationships. Feature selection and engineering were appropriately justified, ensuring meaningful clustering results.
Points
8/8
Criteria
Data pre-processing
- Check the duplicate values, and missing values and add observations. - Write some initial observations on a range of attributes and outliers of various attributes. - Scaling the data before clustering
Comments
Your data cleaning process is well-structured, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers effectively. Scaling and normalization were correctly applied where necessary, improving clustering performance. Encoding categorical variables was done appropriately.
Points
4/4
Criteria
Applying K-means Clustering
- Create the Elbow curve and add the observations - Compute the Silhouette scores for different values of k - Select the appropriate number of clusters with reasons behind them
Comments
Your K-Means implementation is well-explained, with the correct steps followed. The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used effectively to determine the optimal number of clusters. The interpretation of clusters is insightful and provides meaningful segmentation of the data.
Points
8/8
Criteria
Applying Hierarchical clustering
- Create Dendrograms for 2-3 linkage methods out of single, average, complete, ward, centroid, and weighted - Select the appropriate number of clusters with reasons behind them or - Compute the Silhouette scores for different values of k - Select the appropriate number of clusters along with the distance metric and linkage method
Comments
Your Hierarchical Clustering implementation is well-executed, using appropriate linkage methods. The dendrogram is clearly explained and used effectively to determine the number of clusters. You have successfully compared the clustering results with K-Means.
Points
8/8
Criteria
K-means vs Hierarchical Clustering
- Perform cluster profiling on both Algorithms - Add reasons for choosing the appropriate clustering algorithm
Comments
You have critically assessed the advantages and limitations of both techniques, discussing their interpretability, scalability, and performance. Your conclusions are well-supported by data-driven observations.
Points
4/4
Criteria
Actionable Insights & Recommendations
- Add insights on each cluster given - Provide recommendations that can be acted upon to improve the business outcome [Recommendations can also include points on additional data sources for further analysis, model implementation in the real world, potential business benefits from improving the model, etc.]
Comments
Your business recommendations are practical and well-supported by the clustering results. You have clearly identified customer segments or data patterns that can be used for decision-making. The insights are structured and align with the objectives of the project.
